Machine hearing project 

Machine learning + hearing project - a model that distinguishes between announcement in Lisbon metro and other sounds. Then it gets your location and the name of the nearest stop and once it matches your desired destination it notifies you. The idea was to make metro rides more comfortable for hard of hearing so they could enjoy their time rather than stare at the info screen (that are often displaying wrong info about the next stop) waiting for their stop.
